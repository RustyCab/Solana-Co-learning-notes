# Solana Scripting Template

This template is a starting point for writing scripts to interact with the Solana blockchain. Simply add your code to `index.ts` and run `npm start`.

You can create a local repository with this starter code using the `npx create-solana-client [PROJECT_NAME] --initialize-keypair` command in the terminal.
